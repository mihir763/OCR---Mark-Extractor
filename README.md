# OCR-Mark-Extractor

SSIP'22 - Hackathon
It helps ACPDC to fetch useful data of marksheet into database directly.

WORK FLOW :- 
A software, which will take input in the form of pdf or scanned image, then pre-process it to 
make it compatible with our trained model and pass it to the implemented model. The trained
model would extract details (i.e. Math, Science, English, Total Obtained marks and Total
Maximum marks) from the scanned copy and enter it into database columns of Math, Science,
English, Total Obtained marks and Total Maximum marks of a specific database and generate
the message ‘successful entry’ on each successful fetching of details otherwise it would suggest
user to try again. It will also provide the functionality to download the created database in .csv or
.xlsx format.
